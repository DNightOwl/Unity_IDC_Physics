# Unity Physics Simulation

## Overview

This Unity project showcases the implementation of fundamental physics concepts and joints in Unity. The project includes four scenes: "Physics," "Fixed Joint," "Hinge Joint," and "Spring Joint."

## Features

### Physics Scene

  - **Gravity and Bouncing Balls:** Demonstrates the effects of gravity on bouncing balls.
  - **Materials and Textures:** Implementation of materials, including transparent glass, and textures for enhanced visual appeal.
  - **3D Models:** Integration of 3D models to create a visually dynamic environment.
  - **Colliders:** Utilization of different colliders such as Mesh Collider, Sphere Collider, and Box Collider.
  - **RigidBody:** Incorporation of RigidBody components for realistic physics interactions.

### Fixed Joint Scene

  - **3D Bridge:** Implementation of a 3D bridge using colliders, Rigidbody, and FixedJoint components.
  - **Collision Interaction:** Showcase of interaction between the falling ball and the bridge when they collide.

</p>

### Hinge Joint Scene

  - **3D Door:** Implementation of a 3D door using HingeJoint components, colliders, Rigidbody, materials, and textures on the wall.
  - **Automated Movement:** The ball in the scene is scripted to move towards the door to showcase the hinge joint interaction.

### Spring Joint Scene

  - **Invisible String:** Implementation of a 3D scene with an invisible string between a sphere and a cube.
  - **Spring Joint Interaction:** Showcase of interaction between the sphere and the cube using SpringJoint components, colliders, and Rigidbody.

### Acknowledgments

- Unity Asset Store contributors for providing assets used in this project.
- This project was developed as part of a virtual reality (VR) training program [The Interactive Digital Center (IDC)](https://eonreality.com/locations/ben-guerir-ma/#:~:text=in%20their%20sector.-,VR%20Innovation%20Academy,-COMPREHENSIVE%20CURRICULUM). The goal of the training was to apply and reinforce various Unity concepts, including 3D environment design, asset integration, scripting and UI integration with VR and AR functionality.
